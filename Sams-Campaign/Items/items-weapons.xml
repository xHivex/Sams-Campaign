			<html>&lt;p&gt;On a hit, this +2 magical greatsword inflicts slashing damage equal to 2d12 + your Strength modifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The weapon itself is so large and heavy that few can wield it. In ancient tales, the blade is rumored to be made from the blood of thousands of dire wolves.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;This blade is created with the scales of a Void dragon by a Dragonborn master smith. It was once wielded by Dragonborn royalty that followed Bahamut. In addition to its regular damage, it deals 1d10+3 cold damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While attuned to this blade and holding it, your speed is not affected by difficult terrain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While holding the blade, you can use your action to make a radiant blast travel in a 15-foot line, and is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw, DC 20, or take 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against magic putting you to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;A weapon said to have once been used to keep unruly imprisoned wizards in line; it violently disrupts their ability to use magic, inflicting wild and unpredictable residual magical effects on those it strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You have a +3 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature becomes spellbinded until the start of your next turn. Spellbinded targets must roll a d6 before casting a spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a 1, the spell fails and has no effect with the spell slot spend. On a 2-4, the spellcaster takes 2d10 force damage. On a 5-6, the spell is cast as normal, but the caster must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table prior to the casting the spell. &lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;This elegant arcane rifle can fire bolts of arcane energy when fired, due to its installed arcane core. The rifle's arcane core has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge when taking the attack action to make all of the attacks you make as part of that action deal force damage instead of piercing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Additionally, you can expend 2 charges when you make an attack to empower the bolt being fired. If you successfully hit a target, the bullet continues travelling though their body in a straight line for 20 feet. If another creature is struck by the bullet, and the initial attack roll exceeds their AC, they take the same amount and type of damage your first target takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You can also expend 3 charges to overload the rifle's arcane core. The next attack you make will be a critical hit on a roll of 17-20 on a d20, but will misfire on a roll of 1-5 on a d20. If the weapon misfires, it can't fire again until you take an action to attempt to repair it by making a DC 10 Arcana (Intelligence) check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once the arcane core's charges are depleted, they can be fully recharged by infusing them with a spell slot of 1st level or higher as part of a short or long rest.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;Golden Axe of the Monster is a weapon forged from the body of an Gold dragon, infused and binded with absorbing properties of gibbering mouther' flesh. The blade of this axe is purely gold and huge, cutting side is very jagged. The handle is slightly curved, made out of an ancient magical ent and is dark brown with some steel ornaments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magical Weapon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While wielding the Black Axe of the Monster you have a +3 to attack and damage rolls. The weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damage from Strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;To wield the weapon with both hands you must have a Strength score of at least 21. This weapon deals an additional damage on a hit equal to 4d12 slashing damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mighty Slash&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The magical power inside the axe releases its full potential. When damaging a creature with this weapon, you can spend a bonus action to forgo rolling and deal maximum possible damage instead. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power from Magic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you choose to do so, your next succesfull attack with this weapon deal an additional 2d12 damage of the type you took when using this property. Axe can be infused only by one spell at a time. If the spell dealt multiple types of damage, you choose which to use. &lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 30 feet + (your Strength modifier x 5) feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Each creature within 10 feet of an Wild Magic grenade must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, on a failed save, roll on the Wild Magic Grenade table, or nothing happens on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;1d12&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Wild Magic Grenade Effects&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures continuously sneeze for the next 1d4 hours. &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures’ skin and hair color will randomly change for the next 2d4 hours. &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until they sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from their faces. &lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Creatures are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Creatures must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC is 15) and take 14d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures are reduced by one size category for the next 1d4 hours. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures take 1d6 Necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Creatures are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of their next turn, after which time they return to the space they previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;9&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;For the next minute, effected creatures regain 5 hit points at the start of each of their turns. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;An eye appears on the creatures’ foreheads for the next minute. During that time, they have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and gain 30-foot darkvision. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;11&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;For the next minute, the creatures can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of their turns. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;12&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;All creatures regain their lowest-level expended spell slot. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
