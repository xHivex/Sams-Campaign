			<html>&lt;p&gt;On a hit, this +2 magical greatsword inflicts slashing damage equal to 2d12 + your Strength modifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The weapon itself is so large and heavy that few can wield it. In ancient tales, the blade is rumored to be made from the blood of thousands of dire wolves.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;This blade is created with the scales of a Void dragon by a Dragonborn master smith. It was once wielded by Dragonborn royalty that followed Bahamut. In addition to its regular damage, it deals 1d10+3 cold damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While attuned to this blade and holding it, your speed is not affected by difficult terrain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While holding the blade, you can use your action to make a radiant blast travel in a 15-foot line, and is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw, DC 20, or take 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against magic putting you to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;A weapon said to have once been used to keep unruly imprisoned wizards in line; it violently disrupts their ability to use magic, inflicting wild and unpredictable residual magical effects on those it strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You have a +3 to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature becomes spellbinded until the start of your next turn. Spellbinded targets must roll a d6 before casting a spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a 1, the spell fails and has no effect with the spell slot spend. On a 2-4, the spellcaster takes 2d10 force damage. On a 5-6, the spell is cast as normal, but the caster must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table prior to the casting the spell. &lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;This elegant arcane rifle can fire bolts of arcane energy when fired, due to its installed arcane core. The rifle's arcane core has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge when taking the attack action to make all of the attacks you make as part of that action deal force damage instead of piercing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Additionally, you can expend 2 charges when you make an attack to empower the bolt being fired. If you successfully hit a target, the bullet continues travelling though their body in a straight line for 20 feet. If another creature is struck by the bullet, and the initial attack roll exceeds their AC, they take the same amount and type of damage your first target takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You can also expend 3 charges to overload the rifle's arcane core. The next attack you make will be a critical hit on a roll of 17-20 on a d20, but will misfire on a roll of 1-5 on a d20. If the weapon misfires, it can't fire again until you take an action to attempt to repair it by making a DC 10 Arcana (Intelligence) check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once the arcane core's charges are depleted, they can be fully recharged by infusing them with a spell slot of 1st level or higher as part of a short or long rest.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
