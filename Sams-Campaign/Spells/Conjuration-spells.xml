&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier; if you score a critical hit, add twice your spellcasting ability modifier instead. The blade then disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spell creates more than one blade when you reach higher levels: two blades at 5th level, three blades at 11th level, and four blades at 17th level. You can direct the blades at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each blade.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The caster may use his action to fill up a hole. The cloudbed cannot be propelled. A strong wind ends the spell early.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the summon has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a fey instead of a beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Your summon acts independently of you, but it always obeys your verbal commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A summon can't attack, help or use an object, but it can take other actions as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the summon drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you are reduced to 0 hit points or you use an action to do so, you can permanently dismiss your summon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You can't have more than one summon at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a summon, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your summon transforms into the chosen creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spell creates an additional summon when you reach higher levels: Up to two summons can be conjured at 5th level, three summons at 11th level, four summons at 17th level. You can choose to conjured each summon separately or all at once and each summon can be a different creature when you do so.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once chosen, the target can now see the entities and must make a Wisdom or Intelligence saving throw, your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a failed save, the entities circle the target and form into the target's worst fears, dealing 2d4 psychic damage to the target. On a successful save, the target can no longer see the entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (3d4), 11th level (4d4), and 17th level (5d4).&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll against a target with one of these runes, you can destroy one rune to gain advantage on your attack roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you cast magic missile targeting a creature with one of these runes, you can destroy one rune to gain a +4 bonus on the damage roll of one dart. You can destroy any number of runes to affect the same number of darts.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p&gt;In combat, you can issue commands as an action, but if the commands are unreasonable, or too complex to understand, the bird will not obey. [DM has the final ruling.] If the type of bird is not listed in the 5e Monsters Manual, apply the statistics of a roughly equivalently-sized bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The bird will follow you if it is not currently under an order, until it is dismissed or killed. The bird may leave to hunt or scavenge for food on its own, when not currently under an order, but will never fly too far from you to hear your call. If the bird is placed in a cage, the effect will wear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you use this spell while you already have a bird from this spell, the original bird then breaks free from your control.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;During the turn this was cast and whenever an ally starts their turn within range and can hear you, you may roll one of your Bardic Inspiration Die to heal that ally for the amount equal to your roll.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Add one Bardic Inspiration Die for each level higher than 2nd. At 4th level, add +1 AC to all allies within range and double allies movement speed who start their turn within range of this spell. At 7th level, give all allies who attack while they are within range advantage on all their attack rolls for this turn. At 8th level, increase the critical hit range of all allies within range by 1.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A creature within 5 feet of the orb may use its reaction to voluntarily dive on top of the grenade. Such a creature automatically fails its save and takes double damage from the spell, but negates the spell's effect on all other creatures within the spell's range.&lt;/p&gt;

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You summon spirits of 2 passive foxes to aid you. The twin foxes appear in an unoccupied space within range. Their statistics are that of a cat though they are celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of beast, and have an intelligence of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Foxes are friendly (if a bit sarcastic) to you and your companions. While within 40 feet, they can communicate with you or each other telepathically. The Foxes are unnaturally stealthy able to cast the spell invisibility on themselves, and can be used to scout. However if engaged in combat the foxes will refuse to fight instead taking the dash action to flee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The Foxes disappear when not in range to communicate with you for more than 1 hour, they drop to 0 hit points, or you re-cast this spell. Although they retain their memories between summonings they drop anything they are holding when they disappear.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You call forth an intangible horror. It appears in an space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. Typically, the horror resembles a mass of shadows filled with writhing black tentacles and gnashing teeth, although it can appear as any sort of terrifying phenomena of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the horror's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the horror to attack the creature. When you do so, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and becomes frightened of the horror until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chains vibrate with a subtle but powerful hum just under the range of hearing. Human ears cannot detect the sound, but it disturbs concentration, making even innate abilities like a dragon's fire breath or an illithid's plane shift difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Every time a creature restrained by the chains tries to cast a spell (even one without somatic components) or use a spell-like ability it must make a Constitution saving throw or waste the spell or ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you successfully maintain concentration for the length of the duration, 1 minute, the effect lasts for 24 hours unless dispelled or until you dismiss it as an action. The target can make a new escape attempt once every hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;These effects last until you have left the Wizards Tower. This magical doorway will not let another living creature enter the Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tower has dimensions of 40ft Diameter by 50ft Tall and is broken up into 5 rooms; Bedroom/Bathroom, Library/Office/Sitting room/Kitchen and Arcane Laboratory, and a roof. There are windows throughout the tower. When you look out the windows or lookout from the roof, you’ll find you’re in a dense forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The windows are not large enough for you to climb through. If for whatever reason if you fall off the roof you will be spat out of the portal back into the real world right before you hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Time moves faster inside the tower, 2 hours in the tower is 1 hour out. While in the tower you are not protected from Divination magics. You are the only person that may enter this place however that doesn’t mean the tower is frozen in time when you are not there.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You tear a hole to the Far Realm from which emerges a 15-foot long tentacle. Without using an action, you can cause this tentacle to interact with the environment and objects, performing actions such as opening doors and grabbing objects. In combat, you can use the tentacle in the following manners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You can force a creature within the tentacle's reach to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or be grappled by the tentacle. The creature can use an Action to attempt the saving throw again, freeing itself from the grapple on a success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; When a creature is grappled, you can use an Action to cause the tentacle to crush the grappled creature, causing 1d8 bludgeoning damage to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; As an bonus action on your turn, you can cause the tentacle to attack creatures, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can't attack or interact with objects with the tentacle while the tentacle is grappling a creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

You can control all conjured tentacles with the action used to control a single one.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the target is a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw, which it can choose to fail. On a failed save, it teleports to your space and you teleport to its space simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the target is an object no larger or smaller than one size category different from your size, you must make an Intelligence (Arcana), Wisdom (Arcana), or Charisma (Arcana) check against a DC of 25 minus your spell save DC. On a success, you swap places with that object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum range increases by 20ft for each level above 4th.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the beginning of each turn the creature is restrained by the spell, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 2d6 poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;You make a petty wish to fulfill a desire of yours. The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 2nd level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You create one object of up to 100 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 10 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground. The item by all means functions as normal, however it is magical and disappears 24 hours after this spell's casting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You regain a number of hit points equal to double your level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You may choose a damage type. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance to that damage type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For 1 minute, you have advantage on saving throws you would make against magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You magically complete a specific task that would require manual labor if the task would take you 10 minutes or less to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some minor unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;For example, wishing that a villain would die may give them a cold that they simply cure themselves of using magic. Similarly, wishing that you get a bracers of archery may give you an item that you think is a bracers of archery but really does nothing but make you think you are more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress of casting this spell more than once between each time you finish a long rest may weaken you. The 2nd time or more that you cast this spell before finishing a long rest roll 1d100 for each time beyond the first you have cast the spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a 50 or lower, you take 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, on a 20 or lower, your Strength score drops by 2 points, and you regain a single point of Strength when you finish a long rest. Finally, on a 1, you lose the ability to cast this spell.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You summon two glowing chains made of light to restrain an aberration, fiend, or undead within the spell’s range. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be restrained and incapacitated for the spell’s duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Additionally, the creature takes 3d10 radiant damage. While the creature is restrained and incapacitated, it must succeed on the saving throw again at the start of its turns. On a failed save, it takes another 3d10 radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a successful save, it breaks one of the chains. The spell ends early if the creature breaks all of the chains. If a creature takes 50 or more damage from this spell and isn’t native to the plane you’re on, you can use your reaction to banish it to its home plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of chains created increases by one for each slot above 5th.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You summon a dragon of challenge rating 6 or lower. It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The dragon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The dragon is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands to the dragon, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If your concentration is broken, the dragon doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the dragon, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled dragon can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nut Grenades.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As many as four acorns turn into ranged weapons that can be thrown up to 100ft away. To use these objects, it requires you to make a ranged weapon attack to hit the target. Each acorn does 4d6 fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Each nut explodes upon impacting any hard surface. Any combustible materials within 10ft of the target ignites. A targeted creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On success, targets take half damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Berry Bombs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You turn as many as eight berries into special bombs. Berry Bombs have to be placed by hand as attempting to throw it will cause it to detonate on the creature that threw it. If you are within 200ft and speak the command word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Each berry bomb instantly bursts into flame, causing 3d8 fire damage to every creature in a 5ft radius and igniting any combustible materials within 5ft. A creature within the area can make a Dexterity saving throw. On success, targets take half damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or higher, increase the number of nut grenades by 2 or the number of berry bombs by 4.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<supports>Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;Minor wish is the weaker spell of wish, and is basically, wish diluted a lot. It is said that minor wish was created when a wizard failed to cast wish and instead came upon the lesser version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower. You do need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You create one object of up to 500 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 15 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You and up to two other creatures you can see each regain 20 + your level hit points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You and up to one other creature you can see gain resistance to a damage type of your choice for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You and up to two other creatures you can see gain immunity against a spell of 3rd level or lower for 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;For example, wishing for a drought stricken village to get rain might cause a torrential rainstorm. Similarly, wishing for the ability to fly might transform you into an aarakocra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After casting "minor wish", the caster's Strength score reduces by 2, and each time you finish a long rest, you regain one point of lost Strength. Finally, there is a 20% chance you will not be able to cast minor wish again.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a failed save, the creature takes 10d8 necrotic damage, and this spell continues if the creature has a need to breathe. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of your next turn, the creature must succeed on another Constitution saving throw or begin to suffocate, as it has run out of breath. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the spell on a success.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

	<element name="Druidhome" type="Spell" source="Sam's Campaign" id="ID_SACA_SPELL_DRUIDHOME">
		<supports>Druid</supports>
		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;You create an area inaccessible to anyone but you and your compatriots at the heart of a wilderness. A druidhome is equally a place and a representation of the druid’s spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Good-aligned druids’ groves are bright, with lush grass, immortal trees, and populated with good fey and creatures appropriate to the climate and terrain. Evil-aligned druids create groves thick with dangerous thorns, dying trees, and dangerous fey creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once cast, this spell creates a hidden grove with a radius of 60 feet. The entrance is usually a tight tangle of vines or thorns or a dense copse of trees. The druidhome is only accessible by the druid who created it or those the druid names or invites into the druidhome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Anyone attempting to enter a druidhome without permission becomes lost and eventually make their way back to where they started after 1d4 hours of wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the grove is an enormous central tree that produces fruit year round. The fruit is edible, and is identical to a goodberry. This tree may always be the destination of a tree stride spell you cast regardless of the type of tree you enter or the distance involved. A spring bubbles and feeds a small pond of drinkable water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The small grove attracts a number of like-minded fey and other creatures, such as nymphs, dryads, satyrs, and blink dogs. Evil druids may find that their druidhome attracts hags and other evil creatures. These creatures are not under the druid’s control, but they recognize the druid’s ownership of their abode and protects the druidhome from invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The druid may choose to expel any creature as an action, requiring the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is expelled from the druidhome and cannot reenter it for 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each subsequent casting may enlarge the druidhome by an additional 20 feet. Although a druidhome may be any size, it functions as an extra-dimensional space and takes up no space on the Material Plane. Two or more druids may work together, casting the spell to create a larger and more substantial druidhome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;For each druid involved in the creation of a druidhome another central tree grows, and each druid shares an equal claim to the druidhome as a whole. When the ownership of a druidhome comes into dispute, druids war against each other and the survivors gain control of the entire region.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You conjure a 30-foot square, 30-foot deep pit filled with a holocaust of fiery flames. Creatures caught within must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can use its reaction to move to the edge of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a failure, the creature falls into the pit, taking 3d6 non-magical bludgeoning (falling) damage plus 5d6 fire damage and 5d6 necrotic damage. For the duration of this spell, any creature which falls into the pit takes the same damage, and any creature which starts its turn within the pit takes 5d6 fire damage and 5d6 necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Climbing the wall of the pit is possible but difficult, requiring a Strength (Athletics) check of a DC equal to your spell save DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once the duration of this spell ends, or if the spell is dispelled, the magical flames dissipate, but the pit itself remains as a fixture of the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;A druid’s greatest power is to command the forest itself. No other spell proves the truth of this in as direct a manner.

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You conjure a portal to a demiplane of existence of your own design. When first cast, you decide whether your demiplane is an extension of the Feywild, the Shadowfell, an Inner Plane, an Outer Plane, or the Outlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Your demiplane takes up a total of 40 square miles and extends no more than 1 mile vertically. (1 mile into the air, 1 mile below the surface of the ground) At any point of your choosing within your demiplane, you create a permanent structure that will be your private home within the demiplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;This home functions in the same manner as a magnificent mansion, except that your servants are celestials, fey or fiends based on the plane upon which your demiplane anchors and that 3 cubes of your home must be devoted to a throne room. Your demiplane can also contain any 4 of the following amenities of your choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Farmland.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create fertile farmland, which is established upon initial casting. These fields are also required if you wish to build either the Martial Fields or the Stables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marketplace.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create a marketplace that can house merchants of any sort you desire. These merchants are often extraplanar peddlers who offer rare and valuable wares, but you may not determine what is in their stock or what their prices are. Those traits are determined by your DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arena.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create a grand coliseum in which you and any other warrior of your choosing may test their mettle against illusory doubles of any creature of your choice whose CR does not exceed 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grand Gate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create a gateway to any plane. The gate for example could lead to the Court of Pandemonium, The Halls of Mount Celestia, or the Summer Court of the Feywild dependent on the initial choice of anchor plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quarry/Mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create a quarry in which you can harvest valuable stone/metal. You may select to quarry/mine granite or gold from this facility. Monthly, after distributing from trade, you obtain 20 lbs of gold (or 300 lbs of granite) and 500 platinum pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Martial Fields.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote anywhere from one to ten square miles of your demiplane to create training grounds and barracks for a military force. This army consists of 50 Knights and 150 Guards adding an equal number for each additional square mile up to 500 Knights and 1500 guards. While not within your demiplane, you may expend a 9th level spell slot and 100,000 gp to conjure your army.&lt;/p&gt;

If any of your soldiers die during this conjuring, they are returned to your demiplane where they will be restored to full health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;As a note to players and DMs: this part of the spell can get out of hand if you insist on taking control of each individual unit. Please, for the sake of your fellow players, limit this use of the spell to commanding the entire army to act, or at least large groups to act. In general, if you don't know exactly what it is that you want to do with this feature, you should think about it before taking up notable table time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stables.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may choose to devote up to 1 square mile of your demiplane to create grand stables in which you can house a vast array of trained beasts. You also create a staff of laborers to tend to your beasts. When you first cast the spell, you may also select up to 3 beasts of CR 2 or lower which inhabit your stables. You may take any single beast from your stables at a time, allowing the beast to follow you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;These beasts are friendly to you and your companions and take verbal commands from you at no action cost on your part. While a beast is following you, it rolls its own initiative in combat and it acts on its own initiative. If you do not give the beast any commands, it stays within 30 feet of you and defends itself. Each month that passes, you may select a new beast of CR 2 or lower to add to your stables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;After each year that passes, you may select a single beast of CR 5 or lower of your choice to add to your stables.In addition you can use a ninth level spell slot to create a creature of up to CR 20 with additional such spells adding another 5 levels of CR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first casting of this spell, it costs no material components or spell slots to cast it again. Rather, subsequent castings of this spell teleport you and up to 80 willing creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you to the throne room in your grand castle within your demiplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While within your demiplane, you may remain for as long as you desire, but time continues to pass while you remain. You may, at no action cost, banish a creature from your demiplane, shunting them back into the space they inhabited before entering your demiplane. If a creature has been banished, they may not return until you have lifted their banishment.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You restore life to a deceased creature. You can resurrect a creature that died as much as 10 years per caster level before the caster's birth. This spell can bring back creatures whose bodies have been almost entirely destroyed, provided that you have at least a tooth, a fragment of bone, or some bone dust from their former skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution points) or prepared spells, and their flesh is restored to their body. None of the skeleton’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You can revive a creature killed by a death effect or creature who has been turned into an undead skeleton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This spell can only resurrect creatures that once had bones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Even true resurrect skeleton can’t restore to life a creature that has died of old age.&lt;/li&gt;

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You clap your hands, creating a ripple in space that instantly swaps the positions of two creatures or objects within range. Casting this spell requires two free hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Choose yourself and one other target or two targets within 30 feet of you that you can see. The targets instantly swap positions. You may target:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Uncommon or rarer magic items that aren't being worn or carried that you held for 1 minute during the last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Large or smaller creatures of CR 3 or higher. If one or both targets are unwilling, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are swapped. If a single creature makes a successful save, they remain in their original positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwilling creatures that are swapped are disoriented, granting them a penalty equal to your spellcasting ability modifier on their next attack roll before the end of their next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;After your initial clap, while you maintain concentration, you carastesgm continue to use this ability once per round using an action a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you can speak, as part of the initial action to cast this spell you can use a bonus action to reveal how it works. On subsequent uses, if an unwilling target understood you, its penalty to the first attack instead becomes half your spellcasting ability modifier, reduced by 1 for each swap afterwards. However, you can double the number of uses for this spell, cast it as a bonus action instead of an action and its range is increased to 60 feet.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You summon an enlightened bear from the ranks of the Ursine Archivists, a revered order dedicated to the preservation and recording of history. He appears in an unoccupied space within range, wearing a suit and carrying an ornate ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon appearing, the Bear Witness observes and records a significant event unfolding within its sight. The details of this event are inscribed into the bear's ledger with perfect accuracy, later transferred to the eternal archives maintained by their order. Information recorded by the Ursine Archivists is preserved perfectly for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bear Witness is immune to all damage and effects. Its only purpose is to witness the event transpiring and will then leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may request the Bear Witness to recount a specific event that any of the Ursine Archivists have previously witnessed and recorded. The bear will relay the information in detail, providing insight or clarity into the chosen historical event. Those who hear this recounting innately understand that they are receiving an impartial and absolutely truthful account of the events described.

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You conjure a floating basin of glistening, pristine water suspended above the ground in an unoccupied space within range. This basin of water shimmers with a hypnotic allure, drawing the attention of those around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Large or smaller creature within 30 feet that requires water to live and is not immune to being Charmed must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or feel an overwhelming urge to approach and drink from the basin. On a failed save, a creature must use its reaction, to move towards the basin and drink from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If a creature fails the save but cannot reach the basin to drink, it moves as close as possible to it if able and suffers 4d6 psychic damage as the thirst gnaws at its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A creature that drinks from the basin must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer intense dehydration. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 necrotic damage and gains a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Constitution saving throws for the spell's duration, as they feel drained and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a successful save, the creature takes half as much necrotic damage and suffers no additional effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basin holds 3 charges, representing three sips. Each time a creature drinks, one charge is expended. When all charges are consumed, the basin disappears and the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The psychic damage dealt increases by 1d6, the necrotic damage by 1d10 and the basin gains an additional charge (sip) for each spell slot level above 3.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
