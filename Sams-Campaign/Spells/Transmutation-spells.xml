			<html>&lt;p&gt;You move a packet water from a water source within range and hurl it to splash into a creature within range. For the purpose of this spell, a water source is a continguous body of water comprised of at least 5 cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;One creature you designate within 60 feet of the water source must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save, roll 1d4 to determine what effect affects the target:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;d4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Effect:&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Nothing.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The target's movement speed is decreased by 10 until the end of your next turn.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The target is pushed 10 feet away from the water source.&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class="left"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The target is knocked prone.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of the melee attack you make with this spell. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects plus an extra 1d4 force damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage to the target on a hit, and the extra damage the target takes increases to 2d4. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d4) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d4).&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You sacrifice your own vitality to the Weave, offering your strength in exchange for magical prowess. When you cast this spell, your maximum HP gets reduced by 20, and you gain an additional temporary 1st level spell slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You may cast this spell multiple times to gain additional temporary spell slots, reducing your maximum HP by 20 each time. Beware, however: If your maximum HP gets reduced to 0 this way, your body and your very soul get disintegrated into magic and become one with the weave, killing you instantly. Only divine intervention or a wish spell can bring you back from this kind of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You lose all additional spell slots, and regain your maximum HP after a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You manifest a minor magical feat summoned from the realm of dreams. You create one of the following magical effects within range:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; You create illusionary writing (static or animated) which can appear on any surface in range, and be no larger than two square feet. The writing can be in any language you know, and can seem to be written in ink, blood, seeping ichor, or glowing letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You render invisible a single unattended object within range. The object must be no more than eight inches on a side and weigh no more than 1 pound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You summon a very minor creature in range, which can be no larger than a mouse. This creature has only 1 hit point, no effective attacks, and no traits or features just it's movement speed. It lasts until you dismiss it or you summon another creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image in your hand that persists until the end of your next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You instantly light or snuff out a candle, small campfire, torch, or lantern in range with witches' fire; a purple, indigo, or green flame. You can choose it to produce neither smoke nor heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
A non-instantaneous effect produced by this spell lasts for up to one hour.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it. A creature holding an object you attempt to erase can make a successful Dexterity saving throw to avoid your touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spell can also erase magical writing, such as a spell found on the pages of a spellbook or within a spell scroll, or end the effects of one spell which relies on writing of some form, including glyph of warding, illusory script, instant summons, symbol, or teleportation circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When you attempt to erase magical writing, you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a successful check, the writing is erased, ending the spell or rendering the scroll or spellbook pages nonmagical. On a failure, this spell fails and the casting is wasted, and a harmful spell is triggered if applicable (such as with glyph of warding or symbol).&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Velocity from before the target was put in stasis is applied while in stasis, and damage, velocity, force, etc. is applied all at once when the stasis is dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the stasis mine is not detonated 24 hours after being armed, it automatically activates. The stasis mine can not be disarmed except by a successful dispel magic cast with a DC equal to the caster's spellcasting DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the time mine deals 2d6 more damage per level over 1st.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You point at a creature or object within range that weighs 2,000 pounds or less and cause it to become stopped in time. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw when targeted and at the end of each of its turns while affected; on a success, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;For the duration, the target is frozen in place and cannot move of its own volition, becoming paralyzed if it is a creature. Another creature can move the target by using an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, moving the target up to 5 feet on a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target is immune to all damage for the duration; keep track of the amount of damage it is subjected to. When the spell ends, choose a direction. The target is flung in that direction a number of feet equal to twice the damage dealt to it while stopped in time, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A creature or unsecured object in the target's path must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being hit by the target. On a failed save, both the target and the creature or object hit take 4d4 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the target was flung, and a hit creature is knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to one half or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;For the duration, an affected creature becomes rooted to the ground as it and its gear is absorbed into the trunk of a tree that sprouts into being around the creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tree created by this spell is a Large plant with AC 11, 30 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage, and the ground in a 5-foot radius around it is difficult terrain. If a tree is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends for the creature within that tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While affected by this spell, a creature is blinded, paralyzed, and restrained, and it has total cover to effects outside the tree. The creature is in a form of stasis, during which it doesn't need to eat or sleep and is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;When the spell ends for a creature, the wood cracks and falls away from its body, rotting to nothing over the course of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 10 days. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. Using a spell slot of 7th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;As an action, you cause your eyes to glow a sickening green in a 30ft cone. Any creature that is facing you when the cone first becomes active, or starts its turn in the cone, must make a Constitution saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On a failure, the creature's speed is halved. On a second failure, their legs turn to stone and are considered restrained. On a third failure, the creature becomes completely petrified, which can be cured with Greater Restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;An affected creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn if they are not fully petrified. If a creature fails its saving throw by 6 or more, they are instantly petrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless surprised, a creature can choose to avert their gaze at the beginning of their turn or immediately make the save again. If they do so, they cannot see you and must repeat the saving throw if they choose to do something that would make them meet your gaze once more. This includes making an attack against a creature, if they are both in the cone and the one attacking is facing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the end of you turn, you must designate where you are facing and where the cone is aimed. If you are hit by an attack or spell, you can use your reaction, after rolling to maintain concentration, to face the creature the damage originated from, forcing them to repeat the saving throw if they are not averting their gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The sweep from turning your head does not affect creatures in terms of repeating the save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;On subsequent turns after casting this spell, you can use your action to force a creature you can touch to make the saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you see yourself reflected on a polished surface within 30ft and in an area of bright light, you are instantly petrified.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If it fails the saving throw, it begins to undergo a transformation turning it into a bilabial foul. Each round you maintain Concentration on this spell, it produces an additional effect on your turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 1.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The target creature grows feathers along its arms and neck, giving it disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks until the spell ends. Additionally, it has to disadvantage on checks that require the use of arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 2.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The target creature grows a long pointed nose and its neck extends to about 2 feet in length, making it awkward and cumbersome. Creatures gain advantage on melee weapon attacks made against the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 3-9.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Each round until round 10, the creature must make a wisdom saving through. With one failure, the targets intelligence score becomes 7 for the duration (if it is not already lower). At 2 failures, the target forgets any languages known to them and cannot perform the verbal components of spells for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;At 3 failures, their type becomes beast and their hand become short stubby wings, meaning they cannot do tasks that require fingers. At 4 failures, the target assumes the statistics of an axe beak (the DM has the creatures statistics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 10.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The target must make a wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends as normal. On a failed save, the duration becomes "until dispelled." A remove curse spell, greater restoration, or similar magic ends this effect.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;At the start and end of your turn, you may freely move to an open location within this darkness, and you can choose to not be targeted by effects that target specific creatures, as you phase out of reach. If it would deal radiant damage, this is ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

		<supports>Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Haste spell this does not affect your body, but creates a shell of altered time around you making it appear as if you were moving and acting faster than anything else. The shell incorporates your entire body and anything you are holding, save that of another person or creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Whilst this spell is active, on and out of your turn, you gain additional time to do more things. When you cast this spell the time dilation effect gives you an addition 2 seconds to do something on your turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;To determine what you can do you first need to know how long it takes you to perform a task. On your turn you would usually have 6 second to do what you want, see the list below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Movement on your turn, weather you move 10ft or 40ft, is considered to take 3 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; An action takes up 2 second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A bonus action takes up 1 second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack action no matter how many attacks are involved takes up 2 seconds of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;A Spell also takes up time to cast but unlike an attack action you may not be able to cast a second spell. There needs to be a cooldown time of 3 seconds between spells. During that time you can do anything you like but 3 seconds must pass before you can cast a second spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Additionally whilst the spell is active you gain the following effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You gain a bonus to your movement speed equal to +10ft of movement for every second of additional time given by the spell (additional 2 seconds of time gives a +20ft of movement)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You gain a bonus to your AC equal to the additional time given by the spell (additional 2 seconds of time gives a +2 AC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; When making an attack roll you gain advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Your Weapon Attack damage is increased by 1d4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Opponents make attacks of opportunity against you with disadvantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; After your turn you can use multiple reactionary actions or abilities equal to the additional time given by the spell (additional 2 seconds of time allows 2 additional reactions only one of which can be a spell).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Any Strength or Dexterity check you would make has advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the spell ends there is no lingering effect on you body. The shell simple dissolves and you are returned to normal time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you Cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th Level or higher. You gain 1 extra second of time and attack damage is increased by 1d4 for each spell slot above 4th level.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Friendly creatures that enter the sphere gain the effects of the Haste spell while hostile creatures gain the effects of the Slow spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A creature does not need to be fully within the sphere to trigger its effects, simply being in contact with it is enough. Additionally, the effects of Haste and Slow only last while within the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the diameter of Chronos Field increases by 5ft per slot level above 5th.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast, giant, ooze, or plant whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless the new form is also capable of doing so. You do not learn any new languages by using this spell, instead you retain the languages you knew before transforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the new form doesn't wield equipment then the target's gear melds into its new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. If the new form is one that would normally wield some form of equipment then the target's current equipment transforms into the creature's standard equipment, as determined by the DM.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You become a conduit for divine power, allowing you to perform several miraculous effects. For the duration of the spell, you glow softly, shedding bright light within a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If this area of light overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 6th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled. Furthermore, you gain the following abilities for the duration of the spell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by creatures of those types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You can move across any liquid surface as if it were harmless solid ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You can use a bonus action to heal a creature you touch, restoring 3d6 hit points to it and, if you choose, ending one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Once you have used this feature of the spell ten times, you can't use it again until the spell ends.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; The target can breathe normally in any environment, and it has advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).&lt;/li&gt;

			<html>&lt;p&gt;You cause your form to adapt to the evil energies of the multiverse. For the duration, your skin appears to be decaying, you give off a sickening stench, and bile and slime ooze from your pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While in this state, whenever you would take poison or necrotic damage, you take no damage, and instead regain hit points equal to half of the damage you would have taken before resistances and immunities. Any effect that would heal an undead creature also heals you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;You may communicate with undead creatures through rudimentary telepathy and body language, regardless of whether you speak the same language, and undead creatures with 14 or less Intelligence will not automatically attack you unless they are commanded to. Finally, for the duration, you may move freely through oozes and slimes, taking no damage in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The average person will not interact with you in this state; on a failed DC18 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a creature will believe you are undead and will react accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Higher Levels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration increases to 1 hour, and with a spell slot of 9th level, it increases to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

On failed save, they must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. On a success, the creature can hit you as normal but takes 5d10 force damage for each attack they hit you with.&lt;/li&gt;
